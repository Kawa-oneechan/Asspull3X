# Asspull IIIx
This is a fantasy computer that Kawa pulled out of his ass, inspired by [an utter shitpost](https://helmet.kafuka.org/byuugold/viewtopic.php@f=16&t=4792.html). That's really all there is to it; it's a joke gone way out of hand.

To actually *use* this, ROM files are included and more up-to-date copies can be gotten from [the other repo](https://github.com/Kawa-oneechan/Asspull3X-roms).
